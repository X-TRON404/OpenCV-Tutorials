#Here we are going to work with Gaussian adaptive thresholding
#adaptive thresholding is used when we want to apply thresholding for a small region
#when lighting conditions in image change from point to point we use adaptive thresholding
#hence we get different thrsholding values for different regions in the same image

#adaptiveThreshold()
#Use:
'''For applying thresholding to a smaller region instead of applying it to whole image'''
#Parameters:
'''
(1)img
(3)max_val
(4)adaptiveMethod :
(5) thresholdType: The type of thresholding to be applied.
(6) blockSize: Size of a pixel neighborhood that is used to calculate a threshold value.
(7) constant: A constant value that is subtracted from the mean or weighted 
sum of the neighbourhood pixels.

#cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C: 
'''Threshold Value = (Gaussian-weighted sum of the neighbourhood values â€“ constant value). 
The threshold value T(x,y) is weighted sum of the blocksize*blocksize  neighborhood minus C
where c is a constant
